I study how international and domestic politics shape human rights and democratic norms (and vice versa). I use natural language processing (NLP), online survey experiments, and network analysis to address these questions. My dissertation addresses human rights rhetoric as a part of US diplomacy. 

I am currently a PhD Candidate in the Department of Political Science at Emory University. Formerly, I was a Visiting Assistant Professor in the Department of Data and Decision Sciences and Research Faculty Fellow at [the Center of AI Learning](https://ailearning.emory.edu/) at Emory University.

My passion for political science started when I was an exchange student in Hong Kong, during the Umbrella Movement in 2014. I received my B.A. in English literature and linguistics from Sungkyunkwan University in Seoul, South Korea.
