I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Political Science and a graduate fellow in the Department of Quantitative Theory and Methods at Emory University.

I study how international and domestic politics shape human rights norms (and vice versa). My dissertation addresses human rights rhetoric as a part of US diplomacy and develops a measurement of state shaming intensity. My works use natural language processing (NLP), network analysis, and online survey experiments. 
 

I have interests in different models of collaborative research and the role of experiential learning in higher education. My passion for political science started when I was an exchange student in Hong Kong, during the Umbrella Movement in 2014. I received my B.A. in English literature and linguistics from Sungkyunkwan University in Seoul, South Korea.
