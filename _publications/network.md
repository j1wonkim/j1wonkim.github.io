#### Abstract
Why do some human rights issues receive more attention at the UN than others? A leading account argues that states strategically deploy costly issues against adversaries and safer issues against allies, assuming a uniform global hierarchy of issue sensitivity. This study revisits this claim and posits the importance of understanding states' heterogeneous preferences on the issue domains. First, allowing sender effects to vary across issues reveals meaningful heterogeneity in states’ issue emphases after accounting for affinity and network structure. Second, clustering the posterior distribution of sender–issue effects uncovers normative communities—distinct but shallow patterns of residual issue prioritization that cut across geopolitical alignments. Third, small countries rise as linchpins of these normative clusters. These findings suggest issue preferences contribute a secondary but structured layer of variation that does not conform to a universal issue hierarchy.
