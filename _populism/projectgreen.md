#### Abstract
Recent research indicates that incorporating environmental clauses into free trade agreements (FTAs) can boost public endorsement of such agreements. However, it remains unclear whether these provisions can also sway public opinion regarding a specific FTA in the face of anti-trade rhetoric, which highlights perceived inequities within FTAs. Drawing insights from prospect theory, we posit that while environmental provisions in FTAs can enhance support, they alone cannot fully counteract the adverse effects of anti-trade rhetoric, especially when framed as a gain. Our evidence from two survey experiments conducted in the US, where respondents were presented with a hypothetical US-India trade agreement, supports this argument. Environmental provisions do not universally neutralize anti-trade narratives, regardless of whether they are framed as a loss or gain. However, they exhibit some efficacy in altering attitudes within specific subgroups, notably individuals with cosmopolitan identities. This suggests that environmental provisions in FTAs hold value when tailored for targeted voter groups, addressing concerns and garnering support within these segments.
